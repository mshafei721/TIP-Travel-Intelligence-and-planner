# TIP Landing Page Copy Variations

This document provides three complete copy variations for all landing page sections. Each variation uses a different framework, emotional appeal, depth, and primary benefit focus.

---

## Variation 1: FOMO and Urgency
Framework: PAS (Problem - Agitation - Solution)
Emotional appeal: Fear of missing out, anxiety about last-minute issues
Primary benefit focus: Avoid denial, avoid delays, avoid costly rebooking
Depth: Short, punchy, high urgency

Strategic thinking and hypothesis:
- We lead with what can go wrong and how fast it happens, then offer TIP as the fastest fix.
- Hypothesis: Heightened urgency and fear of being denied boarding will increase first-CTA clicks, especially for travelers booking within 30 days.
