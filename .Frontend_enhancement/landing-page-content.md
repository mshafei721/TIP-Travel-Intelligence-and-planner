## 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)
**Goal:** Immediate Value Validation & Trust.

*   **Visual Strategy:** Split screen (50/50).
    *   *Left:* Text & CTA.
    *   *Right:* High-fidelity UI mockup of a TIP Report on a tablet/laptop. **Crucial Detail:** The mockup must show a "Visa Requirement: E-Visa Required (98% Confidence)" card to signal the specific value.

*   **Headline:**
    **Generate a Legal-Grade Travel Report for Your Next Trip in 60 Seconds.**

*   **Subheadline:**
    Stop guessing with outdated blogs. Get nationality-specific visa intelligence, real-time safety analysis, and AI-sequenced itineraries—all verified against official government sources.

*   **Primary CTA Button:**
    **Start My Free Trip Report**  
    *(Subtext under button: No credit card required. Instant generation.)*

*   **Secondary Link:**
    [ View a Sample Report ]

## 2. Problem / Agitation Section
**Goal:** Agitate the pain of "Travel Anxiety" and "Information Overload."

*   **Visual Strategy:** 3 Horizontal columns with simple, high-contrast line icons (Red/Dark Grey).

*   **Headline:**
    **Your Trip Planning is Broken.**

*   **Column 1: The "Tab Fatigue"**
    *   *Icon:* Browser window with infinite tabs.
    *   *Copy:* You have 20+ tabs open: a visa blog from 2021, a weather site, and three conflicting safety maps. Who do you trust?

*   **Column 2: The Legal Risk**
    *   *Icon:* Passport with a "Denied" stamp.
    *   *Copy:* One missing document or transit visa can end your trip at the check-in counter. Airlines don’t accept "I didn't know" as an excuse.

*   **Column 3: The "Generic" Itinerary**
    *   *Icon:* Generic map pin.
    *   *Copy:* ChatGPT gives you the same "Top 10" list it gives everyone else. It doesn't know your budget, your pace, or the weather forecast for *next Tuesday*.

## 3. Solution Section (The "TIP" Way)
**Goal:** Position TIP as the superior, "Professional" alternative.

*   **Visual Strategy:** A "Team" graphic. Instead of showing servers, show the 9 "Agents" as distinct personas/cards connecting to a central "Master Report."

*   **Headline:**
    **Stop Planning. Start Commanding.**
    **Hire a team of 9 AI travel experts to do the work for you.**

*   **The Agent Roster (Grid Layout):**

    *   **The Diplomat (Visa Agent):**
        "Checks entry requirements against official embassy data for your specific nationality and residency."
    
    *   **The Local Guide (Itinerary Agent):**
        "Builds a day-by-day plan that actually makes sense, accounting for weather and travel times."
    
    *   **The Security Analyst (Safety Agent):**
        "Scans real-time political and health alerts to keep you safe, not just 'informed'."
    
    *   **The CFO (Budget Agent):**
        "Calculates daily costs in your currency and flags overspend risks before you book."

## 4. Trust & Differentiation Section
**Goal:** Prove "Why Us" vs. Generic AI.

## 6. FAQ (Objection Handling)
**Goal:** Remove final friction points.

*   **Q: How is this different from a travel agency?**
