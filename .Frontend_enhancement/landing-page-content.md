## 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)
**Goal:** Immediate Value Validation and Trust.

*   **Visual Strategy:** Split screen (50/50).
    *   *Left:* Text and CTA.
    *   *Right:* High-fidelity UI mockup of a TIP Report on a tablet/laptop. **Crucial Detail:** The mockup must show a 'Visa Requirement: E-Visa Required (98% Confidence)' card to signal the specific value.

*   **Headline:**
    **Know Before You Go. Get a Legal-Grade Travel Report in 60 Seconds.**

*   **Subheadline:**
    Stop guessing with outdated blogs. TIP verifies visa rules, live safety alerts, and a day-by-day plan for your nationality and dates, all linked to official sources.

*   **Primary CTA Button:**
    **Generate My Free Report**  
    *(Subtext under button: No card required. Ready in 60 seconds.)*

*   **Secondary Link:**

## 2. Problem / Agitation Section
**Goal:** Agitate the pain of 'Travel Anxiety' and 'Information Overload.'

*   **Visual Strategy:** 3 horizontal columns with simple, high-contrast line icons (red/dark grey).

*   **Headline:**
    **One Missed Detail Can Stop Your Trip.**

*   **Column 1: The 'Tab Fatigue'**
    *   *Icon:* Browser window with infinite tabs.
    *   *Copy:* You have 20+ tabs open and still cannot answer one question: can you enter? Conflicting advice, zero certainty.

*   **Column 2: The Legal Risk**
    *   *Icon:* Passport with a 'Denied' stamp.
    *   *Copy:* One missing document or transit visa means denied boarding. Airlines do not accept 'I did not know.'

*   **Column 3: The 'Generic' Itinerary**
    *   *Icon:* Generic map pin.
    *   *Copy:* Generic lists waste days and money. They ignore your budget, your pace, and the weather next Tuesday.

## 3. Solution Section (The 'TIP' Way)
**Goal:** Position TIP as the superior, 'Professional' alternative.

*   **Visual Strategy:** A 'Team' graphic. Instead of showing servers, show the 9 'Agents' as distinct personas/cards connecting to a central 'Master Report.'

*   **Headline:**
    **Stop Guessing. Get One Report You Can Trust.**
    **Nine AI travel experts build it for you in under 2 minutes.**

*   **The Agent Roster (Grid Layout):**

    *   **The Diplomat (Visa Agent):**
        'Confirms entry requirements for your passport and residency with official links and a confidence score.'
    
    *   **The Local Guide (Itinerary Agent):**
        'Builds a day-by-day route that fits your dates, pace, and forecast.'
    
    *   **The Security Analyst (Safety Agent):**
        'Flags live political and health alerts so you can reroute before you land.'
    
    *   **The CFO (Budget Agent):**
        'Projects daily spend in your currency and warns you before you overspend.'

## 4. Trust & Differentiation Section
**Goal:** Prove 'Why Us' vs. Generic AI.

## 5. Social Proof & Authority
**Goal:** Establish credibility despite being a new tool.
