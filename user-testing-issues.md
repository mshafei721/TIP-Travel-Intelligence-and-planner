user testing issues: 



1. Dashboard Screen: 

* this sentence: "Start planning your next adventure with AI-powered travel intelligence. Get accurate visa requirements, destination insights, weather forecasts, and personalized itineraries—all in one comprehensive report." is not centered. 
* "the create your first trip" button doesn't do anything, it should route to the create trip form. 



2\. App Shell

* the user shown on the top right corner is still showing demo user, it should get the name of the user after authentication. 



3\. my trips page

* when i press create your first trip button, it takes me to the create trip (in the app shell) this should be within the app shell and not a separate page in the navigation.
