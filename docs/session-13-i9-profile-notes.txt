I9 USER PROFILE SETTINGS - API INTEGRATION
------------------------
Status: 78% Complete (Frontend: 85%, Backend: 70%)

## Completed Tasks:

1. Fixed Authentication Integration:
   - Updated lib/api/profile.ts to retrieve Supabase session tokens
   - All API calls now include proper Authorization headers

2. Migrated ProfileSettingsPage to Use API Client:
   - Replaced direct fetch() calls with profileApi functions
   - Fixed endpoint paths to match backend routes
   - All handlers now use lib/api/profile.ts client

3. Implemented Photo Upload with Supabase Storage:
   - Direct upload to profile-photos bucket
   - Public URL generation and profile update
   - Created setup documentation (docs/supabase-storage-setup.md)

4. Fixed Component Bugs:
   - NotificationsSection: Fixed Checkbox onChange to onCheckedChange
   - TravelPreferencesSection: Fixed Checkbox and travel styles
   - Travel styles now match backend: budget/balanced/luxury

5. Documentation:
   - Created docs/supabase-storage-setup.md
   - Created docs/I9-profile-implementation-summary.md
   - Updated feature_list.json with I9 progress

## What's Working:
   - Profile name editing with auto-save
   - Photo upload to Supabase Storage (requires bucket setup)
   - Traveler details form with auto-save
   - Travel preferences with auto-save
   - Notification toggles with auto-save
