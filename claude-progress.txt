## Phase 0 Status: 11/15 features complete (73%)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-12-22 - Session 1):**
Scraping strategy revised after analyzing scraping-apis-for-devs repo:
- ❌ REMOVED: Firecrawl as primary scraper ($49/mo)
- ✅ ADDED: Hybrid 4-layer approach:
  * Layer 1: Custom Playwright scrapers (self-hosted, $10/mo)
  * Layer 2: Apify actors (TripAdvisor, News, $5/mo free tier)
  * Layer 3: Firecrawl (critical visa backup only, $0-20/mo)
- 💰 Cost Impact: MVP $75/mo (down from $110/mo), Production $541/mo (comparable)
- 🎯 Benefit: 4-layer fallback reliability vs single vendor
- 📝 Phase 1 Updated: Added P1-F13 "Build custom Playwright scraper framework"

Total Features: 135 (increased from 134)
Phase 1 Features: 13 (increased from 12)

Features Remaining in Phase 0:
- [ ] P0-F7: Decide on cloud infrastructure (partially done: Render/Railway for MVP)
- [x] P0-F8: Design database schema (done in data_models.md)
- [x] P0-F9: Design API contracts (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [ ] P0-F10: Create design system specification (will do during Phase 1 frontend setup)
- [x] P0-F11: Document user flows (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [x] P0-F12: Research scraping strategy (COMPLETED - hybrid approach decided)
- [x] P0-F14: Initialize git repository (done)
- [x] P0-F15: Create comprehensive documentation (done)

## Key Architectural Decisions Made:

- Tech Stack: Next.js (TypeScript) + FastAPI (Python) + Supabase + Redis + Celery
- Agent Framework: CrewAI with custom orchestrator
- 10 specialized agents: Orchestrator, Visa, Country, Weather, Currency, Culture, Food, Attractions, Itinerary, Flight
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend MVP) → AWS (production)
- Development Approach: Agent-by-agent with testing at each stage

## Notes:

- This is a FIRST RUN initialization
- No code has been written yet (planning phase only)
- All API selections are based on 2025 research
- User needs to configure API keys in .env before Phase 1

Session 2 - 2025-12-22
------------------------
Status: PHASE 0 FINALIZATION (RESEARCH COMPLETE)
Current Phase: Phase 0 - Research & Planning → COMPLETED ✅

## Session Goal:
Finalize all remaining Phase 0 research and documentation review

## Completed Tasks:

     * Tech stack defined
     * Multi-agent architecture documented
     * User flows documented (5 core flows)
     * API contracts documented (all endpoints)
     * Risk mitigation strategies
     * QA strategy and success metrics
     * Development workflow and timeline

   - Reviewed data_models.md (449 lines, 100% complete)
     * 6 database tables fully defined with SQL
     * All JSONB schemas documented
     * RLS policies for all tables
     * Indexes and triggers defined
     * Database functions for automation

   - Reviewed services_config.md (381 lines, 100% complete)
     * 14 external services documented
     * Hybrid 4-layer scraping strategy
     * Configuration checklists for all phases
     * Cost estimates: MVP $75/mo, Production $541/mo
     * Decision rationale for all services

2. ✅ Cloud Infrastructure Decision (P0-F7)
   - Research conducted: Render vs Railway for FastAPI + Celery
   - Sources analyzed:
     * Railway vs Render comparison articles (2025)
     * FastAPI deployment guides
     * Celery worker support analysis

   - **DECISION: Render**
   - Rationale:
     * Built-in background worker support (critical for Celery)
     * Predictable flat pricing ($7-25/mo per service)
     * Free tier available for MVP testing
     * Production-ready defaults and 24/7 uptime
     * Well-documented FastAPI support

   - MVP Deployment Strategy:
     * Phase 1-11: Render Free tier (testing)
     * Phase 12+: Render Starter ($7 web + $7 worker = $14/mo)
     * Frontend: Vercel (free tier)
     * Redis: Upstash (free tier → $10/mo)

   - Alternative considered: Railway
     * Pros: Flexible usage-based pricing, potentially cheaper for variable workloads
     * Cons: No built-in worker support (manual setup), less predictable costs

3. ✅ Updated feature_list.json
   - Marked Phase 0 features as "passes": true
     * P0-F7: Cloud infrastructure ✅
     * P0-F8: Database schema ✅

Session 7 - 2025-12-24
------------------------
Status: AUTHENTICATION & ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (Section 02) COMPLETE ✅
Current Phase: Section 02 Implementation → BUILD SUCCESSFUL

## Session Goal:
Implement complete authentication and account management system with Supabase Auth

## Completed Implementation:

### ✅ Phase 1: Dependencies & Infrastructure (2/2)
- ✅ @supabase/supabase-js@2.89.0 installed

  * Accessibility tests
  * Coverage requirement: ≥90%

## Technical Issues Resolved:

### ✅ Issue 1: Supabase SSR Type Inference Problem
**Problem**: @supabase/ssr type inference broken - table operations typed as 'never'
- Error: `PostgrestFilterBuilder<..., never, never, ...>`
- Root cause: Known compatibility issue between @supabase/ssr@0.8.0 and Database generic types
- Reference: https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/1738

**Solution**: Applied type assertions as workaround
```typescript
// Type assertion needed due to known @supabase/ssr type inference issues
const { error } = await (supabase.from('user_profiles') as any).insert({...})
```

### ✅ Issue 2: useSearchParams() Suspense Requirement
**Problem**: Next.js 16 requires useSearchParams() wrapped in Suspense boundary
**Solution**: Wrapped login page content in Suspense component

### ✅ Issue 3: Database Type Structure
**Problem**: Missing `__InternalSupabase.PostgrestVersion` field in Database type
**Solution**: Generated complete types from Supabase MCP tool with internal metadata

## Features Implemented:

### Authentication Features:
- ✅ Email/password signup with user profile creation
- ✅ Email/password login with rate limiting (5 attempts = 15min lockout)
- ✅ Google OAuth integration
- ✅ Password reset flow (request + reset)
- ✅ Email verification
- ✅ Password change (requires current password)
- ✅ Account deletion with confirmation
- ✅ Session expiry warnings

### Security Features:
- ✅ Real-time password strength validation (weak/medium/strong)
- ✅ Client-side rate limiting with localStorage
- ✅ Email normalization (lowercase)
- ✅ Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on user_profiles table

### UX Features:
- ✅ Loading states on all forms
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Success states with redirects
- ✅ Password visibility toggle
- ✅ Remember me option
- ✅ Rate limit countdown timer
- ✅ OAuth redirect preservation

## Build Status:

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation: PASSED
- All type errors resolved
- Database types properly configured
- No compilation warnings

### ✅ Next.js Build: SUCCESSFUL
```
Route (app)
├ ○ /                         (Static)
├ ○ /forgot-password          (Static)
├ ○ /login                    (Static)
├ ○ /signup                   (Static)
├ ○ /reset-password           (Static)
├ ○ /verify-email             (Static)
├ ƒ /auth/callback            (Dynamic - OAuth handler)
```

## Files Created/Modified:

**Total Files**: 32
- **Utilities**: 7 files (Supabase clients, auth actions, validation, rate limiting)
- **Components**: 13 files (5 base UI + 8 auth components)
- **Pages**: 6 files (login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email, callback)
- **Types**: 2 files (database.ts, auth.ts)
- **Middleware**: 2 files (middleware.ts, supabase/middleware.ts)
- **Tests**: 1 file (tests.md with 60+ test cases)
- **Documentation**: 1 file (updated claude-progress.txt)

## Technical Decisions:

1. **Supabase Auth**: Chosen for managed authentication with RLS integration
2. **Server Actions**: Used for all backend auth operations (Next.js 16 pattern)
3. **Client-side Rate Limiting**: localStorage-based (5 attempts = 15min lockout)
4. **Password Validation**: Real-time with strength indicator
5. **OAuth**: Google integration with redirect preservation
6. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with Database generics (workaround for SSR issue)
7. **Suspense**: Required for useSearchParams() in Next.js 16

## Next Steps:

**User Actions Required:**
1. Configure Google OAuth credentials in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication → Providers → Google
   - Add OAuth client ID and secret
   - Add authorized redirect URIs

2. Test authentication flows:
   - Email/password signup and login
   - Google OAuth flow
   - Password reset
   - Rate limiting (try 5 failed logins)

**Future Tasks (Section 03+):**
- Implement traveler profile creation/editing
- Add profile settings page
- Implement user preferences
- Add session management UI
