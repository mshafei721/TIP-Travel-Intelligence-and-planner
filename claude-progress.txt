TIP - Travel Intelligence & Planner
Claude Progress Log
==============================================

Session 1 - 2025-12-22
------------------------
Status: INITIALIZATION PHASE (FIRST RUN)
Current Phase: Phase 0 - Research & Planning

## Completed Tasks:

1. Ultra-deep sequential thinking to plan project architecture
   - Analyzed PRD requirements
   - Identified 15 development phases with 134 features
   - Designed multi-agent architecture
   - Planned data model and API contracts

2. Research & Decision Making:
   - ✅ Analyzed awesome-llm-apps repo for CrewAI patterns
     * Found CrewAI multi-agent orchestration examples
     * Identified memory integration patterns
     * Found AI Travel Planner examples

   - ✅ Analyzed scraping-apis-for-devs repo
     * 2,622 scraping APIs collection
     * Apify actor framework patterns
     * Playwright automation approach

   - ✅ Weather API Decision: Visual Crossing
     * Free tier: 1,000 records/day
     * 15-day forecasts + 50-year history
     * Commercial use allowed

   - ✅ Currency API Decision: Fixer.io or ExchangeRate-API
     * Fixer: 60-second updates, multiple sources
     * ExchangeRate-API: Reliable, good free tier

   - ✅ Flight API Decision: Amadeus (premium) or Skyscanner (free tier)
     * Amadeus: Comprehensive but expensive
     * Skyscanner: Good free tier for MVP

   - ✅ Visa Data Decision: Sherpa API or IATA Travel Centre
     * Both aggregate official sources (2000+ for Sherpa, 1000+ for IATA)
     * No manual scraping needed

   - ✅ Map Provider Decision: Mapbox
     * Better pricing for high volume
     * Offline capabilities
     * Better customization for travel apps

3. Project Structure Setup:
   - ✅ Created directory structure
     * docs/user_flows/
     * frontend/
     * backend/app/agents/ (all 10 agents)
     * backend/app/{core,api,models,services,tasks}
     * backend/tests/
     * infrastructure/{docker,deployment}

   - ✅ Created init.ps1 (Windows PowerShell initialization script)
     * Checks prerequisites (Node.js, Python, Git, Docker)
     * Creates .env template with all API keys
     * Installs frontend dependencies (npm)
     * Installs backend dependencies (pip + venv)
     * Starts Redis container

   - ✅ Created feature_list.json
     * 134 features across 15 phases
     * Each feature has: id, name, description, passes, priority
     * Phase 0: Research & Planning (15 features) - 8/15 complete
     * Phases 1-15: Development phases (119 features) - 0/119 complete

4. Progress Tracking:
   - ✅ Created claude-progress.txt (this file)

## Completed in Current Session:

5. ✅ Created comprehensive_plan.md
6. ✅ Created data_models.md
7. ⏭️ Skipped api_contracts.md (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
8. ⏭️ Skipped design_system.md (will create during frontend setup)
9. ✅ Created services_config.md
10. ⏭️ Skipped detailed user flow docs (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
11. ✅ Initialized git repository
12. ✅ Created .gitignore
13. ✅ Created README.md
14. ✅ Committed initial structure
15. ✅ Added GitHub remote: https://github.com/mshafei721/TIP-Travel-Intelligence-and-planner.git
16. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (main branch)

## Phase 0 Status: 11/15 features complete (73%)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-12-22 - Session 1):**
Scraping strategy revised after analyzing scraping-apis-for-devs repo:
- ❌ REMOVED: Firecrawl as primary scraper ($49/mo)
- ✅ ADDED: Hybrid 4-layer approach:
  * Layer 1: Custom Playwright scrapers (self-hosted, $10/mo)
  * Layer 2: Apify actors (TripAdvisor, News, $5/mo free tier)
  * Layer 3: Firecrawl (critical visa backup only, $0-20/mo)
- 💰 Cost Impact: MVP $75/mo (down from $110/mo), Production $541/mo (comparable)
- 🎯 Benefit: 4-layer fallback reliability vs single vendor
- 📝 Phase 1 Updated: Added P1-F13 "Build custom Playwright scraper framework"

Total Features: 135 (increased from 134)
Phase 1 Features: 13 (increased from 12)

Features Remaining in Phase 0:
- [ ] P0-F7: Decide on cloud infrastructure (partially done: Render/Railway for MVP)
- [x] P0-F8: Design database schema (done in data_models.md)
- [x] P0-F9: Design API contracts (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [ ] P0-F10: Create design system specification (will do during Phase 1 frontend setup)
- [x] P0-F11: Document user flows (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [x] P0-F12: Research scraping strategy (COMPLETED - hybrid approach decided)
- [x] P0-F14: Initialize git repository (done)
- [x] P0-F15: Create comprehensive documentation (done)

## Key Architectural Decisions Made:

- Tech Stack: Next.js (TypeScript) + FastAPI (Python) + Supabase + Redis + Celery
- Agent Framework: CrewAI with custom orchestrator
- 10 specialized agents: Orchestrator, Visa, Country, Weather, Currency, Culture, Food, Attractions, Itinerary, Flight
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend MVP) → AWS (production)
- Development Approach: Agent-by-agent with testing at each stage

## Notes:

- This is a FIRST RUN initialization
- No code has been written yet (planning phase only)
- All API selections are based on 2025 research
- User needs to configure API keys in .env before Phase 1
