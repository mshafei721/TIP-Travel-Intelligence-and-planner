## Phase 0 Status: 11/15 features complete (73%)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-12-22 - Session 1):**
Scraping strategy revised after analyzing scraping-apis-for-devs repo:
- ❌ REMOVED: Firecrawl as primary scraper ($49/mo)
- ✅ ADDED: Hybrid 4-layer approach:
  * Layer 1: Custom Playwright scrapers (self-hosted, $10/mo)
  * Layer 2: Apify actors (TripAdvisor, News, $5/mo free tier)
  * Layer 3: Firecrawl (critical visa backup only, $0-20/mo)
- 💰 Cost Impact: MVP $75/mo (down from $110/mo), Production $541/mo (comparable)
- 🎯 Benefit: 4-layer fallback reliability vs single vendor
- 📝 Phase 1 Updated: Added P1-F13 "Build custom Playwright scraper framework"

Total Features: 135 (increased from 134)
Phase 1 Features: 13 (increased from 12)

Features Remaining in Phase 0:
- [ ] P0-F7: Decide on cloud infrastructure (partially done: Render/Railway for MVP)
- [x] P0-F8: Design database schema (done in data_models.md)
- [x] P0-F9: Design API contracts (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [ ] P0-F10: Create design system specification (will do during Phase 1 frontend setup)
- [x] P0-F11: Document user flows (covered in comprehensive_plan.md)
- [x] P0-F12: Research scraping strategy (COMPLETED - hybrid approach decided)
- [x] P0-F14: Initialize git repository (done)
- [x] P0-F15: Create comprehensive documentation (done)

## Key Architectural Decisions Made:

- Tech Stack: Next.js (TypeScript) + FastAPI (Python) + Supabase + Redis + Celery
- Agent Framework: CrewAI with custom orchestrator
- 10 specialized agents: Orchestrator, Visa, Country, Weather, Currency, Culture, Food, Attractions, Itinerary, Flight
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend MVP) → AWS (production)
- Development Approach: Agent-by-agent with testing at each stage

## Notes:

- This is a FIRST RUN initialization
- No code has been written yet (planning phase only)
- All API selections are based on 2025 research
- User needs to configure API keys in .env before Phase 1

Session 2 - 2025-12-22
------------------------
Status: PHASE 0 FINALIZATION (RESEARCH COMPLETE)
Current Phase: Phase 0 - Research & Planning → COMPLETED ✅

## Session Goal:
Finalize all remaining Phase 0 research and documentation review

## Completed Tasks:

     * Tech stack defined
     * Multi-agent architecture documented
     * User flows documented (5 core flows)
     * API contracts documented (all endpoints)
     * Risk mitigation strategies
     * QA strategy and success metrics
     * Development workflow and timeline

   - Reviewed data_models.md (449 lines, 100% complete)
     * 6 database tables fully defined with SQL
     * All JSONB schemas documented
     * RLS policies for all tables
     * Indexes and triggers defined
     * Database functions for automation

   - Reviewed services_config.md (381 lines, 100% complete)
     * 14 external services documented
     * Hybrid 4-layer scraping strategy
     * Configuration checklists for all phases
     * Cost estimates: MVP $75/mo, Production $541/mo
     * Decision rationale for all services

2. ✅ Cloud Infrastructure Decision (P0-F7)
   - Research conducted: Render vs Railway for FastAPI + Celery
   - Sources analyzed:
     * Railway vs Render comparison articles (2025)
     * FastAPI deployment guides
     * Celery worker support analysis

   - **DECISION: Render**
   - Rationale:
     * Built-in background worker support (critical for Celery)
     * Predictable flat pricing ($7-25/mo per service)
     * Free tier available for MVP testing
     * Production-ready defaults and 24/7 uptime
     * Well-documented FastAPI support

   - MVP Deployment Strategy:
     * Phase 1-11: Render Free tier (testing)
     * Phase 12+: Render Starter ($7 web + $7 worker = $14/mo)
     * Frontend: Vercel (free tier)
     * Redis: Upstash (free tier → $10/mo)

   - Alternative considered: Railway
     * Pros: Flexible usage-based pricing, potentially cheaper for variable workloads
     * Cons: No built-in worker support (manual setup), less predictable costs

3. ✅ Updated feature_list.json
   - Marked Phase 0 features as "passes": true
     * P0-F7: Cloud infrastructure ✅
     * P0-F8: Database schema ✅
